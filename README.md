# Self Driving Cab Using Reinforcement Learning
In this project, the Self-Driving cab task is studied.  The major goal is to demonstrate, in a simplified environment, how can Reinforcement Learning techniques be used to develop an efficient  and  safe  approach  for  picking  up  and  dropping  passengers.
