# Self Driving Cab Using Reinforcement Learning methods (Q-learning and DQN)
<br /><br />

Useful bits of knowledge before start:
+ First of all, please read The Reinforcment Learning book in second edition from this link ["Sutton & Barto" ](https://www.dbooks.org/reinforcement-learning-0262039249/).
+ There is a absolutely Free Resources for Reinforcement Learning [here](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/absolutely-free-resources-for-reinforcement-learning-d16a5230cb0f)
+ Also if you want to work with MATLAB you can read this link [RL with MATLAB](https://github.com/MinaR-90/Self-Driving-Cab-Using-Reinforcement-Learning/issues/1) too. 



In this project, the Self-Driving cab task is studied.  The major goal is to demonstrate, in a simplified environment, how can Reinforcement Learning techniques be used to develop an efficient  and  safe  approach  for  picking  up  and  dropping  passengers.
