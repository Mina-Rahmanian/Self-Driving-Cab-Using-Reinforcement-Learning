<br /><br />

Useful bits of knowledge before start:
+ First of all, please read The Reinforcment Learning book "Sutton & Barto" in second edition from this link "https://www.dbooks.org/reinforcement-learning-0262039249/".

In this project, the Self-Driving cab task is studied.  The major goal is to demonstrate, in a simplified environment, how can Reinforcement Learning techniques be used to develop an efficient  and  safe  approach  for  picking  up  and  dropping  passengers.
